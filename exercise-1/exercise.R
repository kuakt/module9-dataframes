# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in each game this
# season (google "Seahawks" for the info!)
good.points <- c(20,25,31,15,5,7,10,3,34,25,6,20)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored
# against them in each game this season
bad.points <- c(25,31,24,26,14,40,38,24,31,23,26,36)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
seahawks <- data.frame(good.points, bad.points)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points.
# Hint: recall the syntax for assigning new elements (which in this case will be
# a vector) to a list!
seahawks$diff <- seahawks$good.points - seahawks$bad.points

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won
seahawks$won <- c(seahawks$diff > 0)

# Create a vector of the opponent names corresponding to the games played
seahawks$names <- c("Saints", "Bills", "Patriots", "Eagles", "Buccaneers", "Panthers", "Packers", "Rams", "Cardinals", "49ers", "Lions", "Falcons")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents


# View your data frame to see how it has changed!
